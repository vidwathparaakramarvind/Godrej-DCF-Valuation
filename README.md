# Godrej Consumer Products – Equity Research & DCF

This folder contains my equity research project on Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. It combines an FMCG industry overview with a DCF valuation of GCPL. 
This project was originally completed as part of an equity valuation course and is now organised here so that the model and reasoning are easy to review and reuse

## Summary

- Forecasted revenue and margins and built a 10-year free cash flow model.
- Estimated WACC using CAPM for cost of equity and observed cost of debt.
- Compared implied fair value per share from the DCF to the then-market price.
- Concluded the stock was modestly undervalued at the time of the analysis, leading to a *BUY* view.
